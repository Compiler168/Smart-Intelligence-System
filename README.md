## EDA & Data Pipeline

### Exploratory Data Analysis Overview

The **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** section documents the complete data journey from raw collection through preprocessing, analysis, visualization, and feature engineering that informs the ML models. All EDA artifacts, scripts, and datasets are located in the `ml/eda/` folder.

### 1. Raw Data Layer

**Location:** `ml/eda/data/raw/loan_dataset.csv`

- **Source**: Loan application records from financial institutions
- **Size**: ~10,000 rows of customer loan applications
- **Format**: CSV (tabular structure)
- **Key Fields**:
  - **Financial Metrics**: `monthly_income`, `monthly_expenses`, `credit_score`, `savings_balance`, `loan_amount`
  - **Loan Details**: `loan_term_months`, `interest_rate`, `existing_loans`, `existing_emi`
  - **Risk Factors**: `missed_payments_last_year`, `bankruptcies`
  - **Demographics**: `age`
  - **Target Variable**: `approved` (binary: approved/rejected)

---

### 2. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

**Script Location:** `ml/eda/analysis/data_cleaning.py`

**Processing Steps:**
- **Missing Value Handling**
  - Numeric fields (skewed): median imputation
  - Categorical fields: mode imputation
  - Documented thresholds in `ml/eda/analysis/eda_report.md`
  
- **Outlier Detection & Treatment**
  - IQR method for extreme values
  - Domain-based validation for financial metrics
  
- **Feature Engineering**
  - Derived **Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI)** = `(monthly_expenses + existing_emi) / monthly_income`
  - Computed **Requested EMI** based on loan amount and term
  - Created **Savings Ratio** = `savings_balance / monthly_income`
  - Derived **Loan-to-Income Ratio** = `loan_amount / annual_income`

**Output:** `ml/eda/data/cleaned/loan_dataset_cleaned.csv`

---

### 3. Cleaned Data Layer

**Location:** `ml/eda/data/cleaned/loan_dataset_cleaned.csv`

- **Size**: Clean dataset ready for ML model training
- **Quality Checks**:
  - No missing values after imputation
  - Outliers handled and documented
  - All derived features computed
  - Data types validated

---

### 4. Exploratory Data Analysis

**Report:** `ml/eda/analysis/eda_report.md`
**Code:** `ml/eda/analysis/eda_script.py`

#### Data Distribution Analysis
- **Target Variable**: Distribution of approved vs. rejected loans
  - Visualized in: `ml/eda/analysis/target_dist.png`
  - Insight: Identifies class imbalance → informs training strategy
  
- **Numeric Feature Distributions**:
  - Histograms and KDE plots for income, credit score, loan amount
  - Identified skewness and modality for transformation planning

- **Categorical Features**:
  - Count analysis and low-frequency category detection
  - Decision on grouping or removal

#### Missing Value Analysis
- Documented patterns of missingness
- Justification for imputation method per field
- Impact assessment on downstream models

#### Feature Correlation Analysis
- **Heatmap Visualization**: `ml/eda/analysis/correlation_heatmap.png`
- **Key Findings**:
  - Credit score shows strong negative correlation with rejection
  - DTI ratio highly predictive of loan approval
  - Income and loan amount show expected positive correlation
  - Multicollinearity detection and feature selection

---

### 5. Visualization Layer

**Location:** `ml/eda/analysis/`

| Visualization | File | Insight |
|---|---|---|
| **Approval Distribution** | `target_dist.png` | Shows class balance/imbalance in dataset |
| **Correlation Heatmap** | `correlation_heatmap.png` | Feature relationships and multicollinearity |
| **Credit Score vs. Approval** | `credit_score_vs_approved.png` | Strong risk signal for predictions |
| **DTI Ratio vs. Approval** | `dti_ratio_vs_approved.png` | Repayment burden predictive power |
| **Loan Amount vs. Approval** | `loan_amount_vs_approved.png` | Requested amount impact on decision |
| **Monthly Income vs. Approval** | `monthly_income_vs_approved.png` | Income sufficiency relationship |

**Visualization Types**:
- Histograms & density plots for distributions
- Heatmaps for correlation matrices
- Scatter plots for bivariate relationships
- Box plots for outlier detection

---

### 6. Key Insights & Findings

1. **Credit Score is Critical**
   - Low credit scores (< 600) strongly associate with rejection
   - Recommended as high-priority feature in models

2. **Debt-to-Income Ratio Matters Most**
   - Derived DTI feature outperforms raw income/expenses
   - Threshold around 0.4–0.5 separates approval tiers

3. **Missed Payments & Bankruptcies are Risk Multipliers**
   - Even one missed payment in last year reduces approval by 30%+
   - Any bankruptcy history is near-automatic rejection signal

4. **Income Thresholds Exist**
   - Minimum monthly income of ~5,000 needed for standard loans
   - Loan-to-Income ratio of < 5x improves approval odds

5. **Class Imbalance Detected**
   - ~65% approved, 35% rejected
   - Requires balanced sampling or weighted loss in training

---

### 7. EDA Impact on Model Development

#### Feature Engineering Decisions
- **Keep derived features**: DTI, Requested EMI, Savings Ratio, Loan-to-Income
- **Drop redundant fields**: Original expense + income (use DTI instead)
- **Encode categorical**: Binary encoding for bankruptcy, scaled numeric features

#### Model Selection Implications
- Class imbalance suggests: F1-score focus, not just accuracy
- Feature importance will guide ensemble weights
- Logistic regression baseline before ensemble methods

#### Sampling Strategy
- Stratified train/test split to preserve class proportions
- Optional oversampling of minority (rejected) class in training
- Cross-validation with stratified k-fold

#### Validation Approach
- Test set held separately from EDA to avoid leakage
- Calibration analysis for probability outputs
- Threshold tuning based on business false-positive cost

## User Journey

1. User registers in the Android Application developed in Java.
2. The app sends credentials to `POST /api/auth/register`.
3. Backend creates the user in Firestore and returns JWT.
4. User logs in and receives a secured session.
5. User submits loan details to `POST /api/loans/predict`.
6. Backend forwards the request to the ML service and writes the result to Firestore.
7. User views predictions, health score, risk analysis, and report summaries.
8. User interacts with the AI chat assistant for financial guidance.
9. User can request reports and view history in-app.

---

## Future Enhancements

- Multi-bank integration with Open Banking APIs
- Fraud detection and anomaly monitoring
- AI chat assistant with voice support
- Predictive financial forecasting and budgeting
- Personalized loan marketplace recommendations
- Secure bank account linking and payment tracking
- Adaptive risk scoring using real-time market data

## Optimization Report

### Key improvements
- Simplified repository layout: `android/`, `backend/`, `ml/` to improve discoverability and maintainability
- Centralized EDA under `ml/eda/` and model artifacts under `ml/models/`
- Preserved Docker-ready service definitions for backend and ML service
- Maintained CI pipeline while removing unnecessary deployment wrappers
- Improved security posture with explicit ignore rules for secrets

---

## Project Highlights

- Production-ready Android Application developed in Java
- FastAPI-based ML microservice with ensemble prediction
- Firestore-backed backend with secure JWT auth
- AI chatbot and financial simulation engine
- CI/CD with GitHub Actions and Docker
---

## Contributing Guidelines

Contributions should follow these rules:
- Keep changes small and focused
- Document new features in README or architecture docs
- Add tests for backend and ML service changes
- Avoid committing credentials or local environment files
- Maintain consistent code organization within `android/`, `backend/`, and `ml/`

---

## Developer Notes

- The Android Application is the primary user experience layer (located in `android/`).
- The backend handles auth, persistence, and ML service orchestration (located in `backend/`).
- The ML service is a standalone FastAPI app designed to be deployed independently (located in `ml/`).
